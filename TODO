    * lint checker
        -- for all our packages, check they are consistent

    * hackage version checker
        -- automatically check versions between hackage and AUR

    * cabal2arch version checker
        -- list all packages that were generated with which version of cabal2arch,
            then auto-rebuild

    * regression builds

Oh,also, anyone know how I can get the full list of arch-haskell
maintained packages from AUR programmatically? I've found only very
sparse documentation for the JSON interface.

If we could get the full package list, we can do regression builds.
